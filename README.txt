Create precision recall graphs comparing every descriptor you implemented with
reasonable parameter choices for each one.

With your README file, make some general observations about which ones seem
to perform better and why you think that might be the case

Create precision recall graphs which show the effect of choosing different
numbers of bins for the basic shell histogram

Create precision recall graphs which show the effect of choosing different
numbers of random samples for the D2 histogram

If you've implemented any of the alternative histogram distance metrics,
make at least one precision recall graph using different metrics on the
same descriptor and showing the effect

At least one other precision recall graph (for instance, if you implemented
the extended Gaussian Image, how does the number of sphere sampled normal
directions affect the results?)
